# Building a Revenue Operations Team from Scratch

When I joined my current company, "Revenue Operations" meant one person in sales ops who ran reports and maintained Salesforce. By the time we scaled past $500M ARR, RevOps was a 15-person team spanning sales, marketing, customer success, billing, and finance operations.

That evolution wasn't random. It followed a hiring sequence, role structure, and operating model that I've now used twice. Here's the playbook.

## What Revenue Operations Actually Is

Before you hire anyone, you need to be clear about what problem RevOps is solving.

**Revenue Operations is the function that removes friction from the revenue engine.**

Not "the revenue engine." That's Sales, Marketing, and Customer Success. RevOps is the oil in the machine — the systems, processes, data, and analytics that let revenue teams operate efficiently.

Too many companies build RevOps as a "sales support" function. That's not wrong, but it's incomplete. RevOps should own the **end-to-end revenue process**, from lead to cash.

That means:
- **Data accuracy** across CRM, billing, product, and finance systems
- **Process design** for how deals move through the pipeline
- **Tool ownership** for the revenue tech stack
- **Analytics and reporting** that drive decision-making
- **Cross-functional alignment** so Sales, Marketing, and CS aren't working in silos

If your RevOps team is only doing one or two of these things, you're underutilizing the function.

## The First Hire: Revenue Operations Manager

Your first RevOps hire is the foundation. Get this wrong and you'll spend a year backfilling mistakes.

### What to Look For

**Not:** A junior analyst or coordinator. Your first RevOps hire needs to be **player-coach** level — someone who can build systems *and* operate them while you scale.

**Look for:**
- 5-7 years in sales ops, marketing ops, or a similar analytical operations role
- Hands-on experience with Salesforce (or your CRM) — not just "I use it," but "I admin it"
- SQL skills (or at least strong Excel/spreadsheet modeling)
- Evidence of process design (they've built workflows, not just followed them)
- Cross-functional instincts (they think about the full funnel, not just their silo)

### What They Own

In the first 90 days, your RevOps Manager should:

1. **Audit the current state.** What systems exist? What data is broken? What processes are manual?
2. **Build the reporting foundation.** Weekly sales metrics, pipeline analysis, conversion funnels. If leadership can't see the revenue numbers clearly, nothing else matters.
3. **Fix the biggest broken thing.** There's always one glaring issue — bad lead routing, duplicate accounts, missing data fields. Fix it fast to build credibility.

### Reporting Structure

RevOps should report into **Revenue Leadership** (CRO, VP Sales, or VP Revenue) or **Finance** (CFO, VP Finance). Both work, but they optimize for different outcomes.

- **Reporting to Revenue:** RevOps will prioritize sales velocity, pipeline visibility, and revenue growth. Great for high-growth companies that need speed.
- **Reporting to Finance:** RevOps will prioritize data accuracy, compliance, and financial reporting. Great for companies approaching scale milestones where clean data matters more than speed.

I've done it both ways. My preference: **report to Revenue early, transition to Finance as you scale past $200M ARR.**

## The Second Hire: Sales Operations Analyst

Once your RevOps Manager is in place and the foundation is stable, your second hire is a **Sales Operations Analyst**.

### What to Look For

This is your "make it happen" person. They handle the day-to-day operational work that keeps the revenue engine running.

**Look for:**
- 2-4 years in sales ops, business operations, or analytics
- Strong Salesforce administration skills (reports, dashboards, workflows)
- Comfort with data (they don't need to write SQL yet, but they should be Excel-native)
- Detail-oriented and execution-focused (this role is about getting things done, not strategy)

### What They Own

- **Salesforce administration:** User setup, data cleanup, field updates, report building
- **Tactical sales support:** Territory assignments, quota tracking, comp plan administration
- **Pipeline reporting:** Weekly metrics, forecast analysis, deal reviews
- **Tool management:** Sales tools like Outreach, Gong, LinkedIn Sales Navigator

This role is the **operational backbone** of your sales team. They're the person who makes sure Salesforce actually works, reports are accurate, and salespeople can focus on selling.

## The Third Hire: Marketing Operations Specialist

If your company has a marketing team generating leads, your third hire is **Marketing Operations**.

### What to Look For

Marketing Ops is a distinct skill set from Sales Ops. Don't assume your Sales Ops person can cover both (they can't, unless they're exceptional).

**Look for:**
- 3-5 years in marketing ops, demand gen ops, or campaign operations
- Hands-on experience with marketing automation (Marketo, HubSpot, Pardot)
- Understanding of lead lifecycle (MQL, SQL, lead scoring, attribution)
- Campaign execution experience (email workflows, landing pages, A/B testing)

### What They Own

- **Marketing automation:** Campaign builds, email workflows, lead nurturing
- **Lead management:** Lead routing, scoring, qualification handoff to Sales
- **Attribution modeling:** Tracking what marketing activities drive pipeline
- **Integration management:** Connecting marketing tools to CRM and ensuring data flows correctly

Marketing Ops is where most companies make their first **cross-functional mistake**: they hire a Marketing Ops person who only knows marketing systems. You need someone who understands how marketing feeds sales, and how data flows between systems.

## The Fourth Hire: Billing/Revenue Analyst

This is the hire most companies skip, and it's a mistake. If you're running a SaaS business, **billing operations is part of revenue operations**, not just a finance function.

### What to Look For

**Look for:**
- 3-5 years in billing ops, order-to-cash, or revenue accounting
- Experience with billing platforms (Stripe, Zuora, Chargebee) and ERP systems (NetSuite, SAP)
- Understanding of subscription billing (proration, renewals, amendments)
- Comfortable with ASC 606 concepts (even if not an accountant)

### What They Own

- **Billing accuracy:** Ensuring invoices match contracts, usage is billed correctly, proration logic works
- **Revenue recognition:** Translating billing data into rev rec schedules
- **Contract management:** Tracking amendments, renewals, pricing changes
- **System integration:** Ensuring CRM, billing, and ERP stay in sync

This role is the **bridge between Sales and Finance**. They translate deals closed in Salesforce into accurate invoices and clean financial data.

## The Fifth+ Hires: Specialization Based on Need

By the time you're making your fifth RevOps hire, you're no longer building a foundation — you're scaling based on **where the operational pain is**.

Common specialized roles:

### Customer Success Operations
**When to hire:** If CS is a significant revenue driver (expansion, upsells, renewals)
**What they own:** CS platform (Gainsight, ChurnZero), health scoring, renewal forecasting, expansion pipeline

### Revenue Analytics / Business Intelligence
**When to hire:** When leadership needs deeper insights than basic reporting
**What they own:** Data modeling, predictive analytics, cohort analysis, executive dashboards

### Revenue Systems Engineer
**When to hire:** When your tool integrations become complex and fragile
**What they own:** API integrations, data pipelines, system architecture, custom development

### Deal Desk / Quote Operations
**When to hire:** When deal complexity increases (custom pricing, non-standard terms)
**What they own:** Quote configuration (CPQ), deal structure review, approval workflows, pricing analysis

## Role Definitions: Who Owns What

A common failure mode: hiring RevOps people without clear ownership, leading to either duplication of work or gaps where nobody owns critical processes.

Here's a clean RACI for core RevOps functions:

| Function | RevOps Manager | Sales Ops | Marketing Ops | Billing Ops |
|----------|---------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| CRM Strategy | **R/A** | C | C | I |
| Salesforce Admin | A | **R** | C | C |
| Pipeline Reporting | **R/A** | C | I | I |
| Lead Management | A | C | **R** | I |
| Marketing Attribution | A | I | **R** | I |
| Billing Accuracy | A | I | I | **R** |
| Revenue Recognition | A | I | I | **R** |
| Tech Stack Ownership | **R/A** | C | C | C |
| Cross-Functional Process | **R/A** | C | C | C |

**R** = Responsible (does the work)
**A** = Accountable (owns the outcome)
**C** = Consulted
**I** = Informed

## KPIs: How to Measure RevOps Success

RevOps is a **leverage function** — you measure success by how much you enable revenue teams to perform better, not by activity metrics.

### Team-Level KPIs

**Sales Efficiency Metrics:**
- **Sales Cycle Length** (days from opportunity created to closed/won) — target: 10-20% reduction year-over-year
- **Win Rate** (closed/won as % of total opportunities) — target: maintain or improve as volume scales
- **Pipeline Coverage Ratio** (pipeline value / quota) — target: 3-4x depending on sales cycle

**Data Quality Metrics:**
- **CRM Data Completeness** (% of required fields populated) — target: >95%
- **Lead Routing SLA** (time from lead creation to assignment) — target: <5 minutes
- **Billing Accuracy** (% of invoices that require corrections) — target: <2%

**System Performance Metrics:**
- **Tool Adoption Rate** (% of team actively using core tools) — target: >90%
- **Integration Uptime** (% time critical integrations are functional) — target: 99.5%
- **Reporting Latency** (time from data event to dashboard update) — target: <24 hours

### Individual Role KPIs

**Sales Ops Analyst:**
- Salesforce report requests completed within SLA (target: 95% within 48 hours)
- Data quality score (% of accounts with complete information)
- User satisfaction score (quarterly survey of sales team)

**Marketing Ops Specialist:**
- Campaign launch success rate (% of campaigns launched on time, error-free)
- Lead processing time (time from lead capture to CRM entry)
- Attribution model accuracy (% of pipeline with source attribution)

**Billing Ops Analyst:**
- Invoice accuracy rate (% of invoices correct on first attempt)
- Billing cycle time (days from period close to invoice generation)
- Revenue recognition variance (actual vs. expected rev rec)

## Common Organizational Design Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Building RevOps as "Sales Support"

**The Problem:** RevOps reports to Sales, only serves Sales, and ignores Marketing and CS operational needs.

**The Fix:** Position RevOps as a **cross-functional enablement team**. They support the entire revenue org, not just one function.

### Mistake 2: Hiring for Tools, Not Outcomes

**The Problem:** "We need a Salesforce admin" or "We need a HubSpot expert."

**The Fix:** Hire for **operational thinking and problem-solving**. Tools change. The ability to design processes and solve complex problems doesn't.

### Mistake 3: Treating RevOps as a Cost Center

**The Problem:** RevOps is seen as overhead, not revenue enablement. Budget is limited, headcount is scrutinized.

**The Fix:** Measure and communicate **revenue impact**. If RevOps reduces sales cycle by 15%, that's millions in accelerated revenue. Quantify it.

### Mistake 4: No Career Path

**The Problem:** RevOps is seen as a dead-end job. Talented people leave for other opportunities.

**The Fix:** Build a **clear career ladder**: Analyst → Senior Analyst → Manager → Senior Manager → Director → VP of Revenue Operations. Show people where this leads.

### Mistake 5: Siloed RevOps Functions

**The Problem:** Sales Ops, Marketing Ops, and CS Ops operate independently with no coordination.

**The Fix:** Create **shared goals and cross-functional projects**. Weekly syncs. Shared KPIs. Joint ownership of end-to-end processes (lead to close, close to renewal, etc.).

## The Operating Model: How RevOps Teams Actually Work

RevOps isn't just a collection of people. It's a **system of coordination** across revenue functions.

### Weekly Cadence

- **Monday: RevOps team standup** (30 min) — what's shipping this week, what's blocked
- **Tuesday: Sales leadership metrics review** (45 min) — pipeline, forecast, performance
- **Wednesday: Cross-functional intake meeting** (30 min) — new requests from Sales, Marketing, CS
- **Thursday: Project status review** (30 min) — updates on in-flight initiatives
- **Friday: Data quality check** (15 min) — spot-check CRM, billing, integration health

### Monthly Cadence

- **Business review with leadership** — deep-dive metrics, trends, recommendations
- **Process improvement workshop** — identify and fix one broken process
- **Tool usage audit** — what's working, what's not, what can we sunset
- **Cross-functional retrospective** — feedback from revenue teams on RevOps support

### Quarterly Cadence

- **Strategic planning** — what are the next quarter's priorities
- **Tech stack evaluation** — renew, replace, or add tools
- **Headcount planning** — where do we need to add capacity
- **KPI review and adjustment** — are we measuring the right things

## The Bottom Line

Building a RevOps team from scratch isn't about copying what works at other companies. It's about understanding **where your specific revenue engine has friction** and building the operational muscle to remove it.

Start with a strong **player-coach RevOps Manager**. Add **Sales Ops** to handle day-to-day execution. Layer in **Marketing Ops** and **Billing Ops** as those areas scale. Specialize based on where your pain points are.

Measure success by how much you **enable revenue teams to perform**, not by how many reports you build.

And most importantly: RevOps isn't a "nice to have" function. It's the infrastructure that lets your revenue engine scale without breaking.

Build it right, and it becomes one of the most valuable teams in the company. Build it wrong, and your revenue teams will spend more time fighting internal systems than winning deals.
