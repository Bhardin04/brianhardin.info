# Building a Collections Strategy That Doesn't Destroy Customer Relationships

I once watched a collections agent leave a voicemail that ended with: "If we don't receive payment by end of business today, we'll have no choice but to suspend your account."

The customer? A $300K/year enterprise client whose payment was 15 days late because their AP department was transitioning to a new system.

They paid the next day. They also cancelled the renewal six months later.

**That's an expensive collections call.**

Here's the tension: You need to collect what's owed. Your CFO is tracking DSO (Days Sales Outstanding), your board wants predictable cash flow, and past-due invoices tie up working capital. But aggressive collections tactics can damage customer relationships, increase churn, and cost you far more than the late payment.

The question isn't *whether* to collect. It's **how to collect in a way that preserves the relationship.**

## The Collections Paradox

Most SaaS companies approach collections like traditional B2B businesses: invoice goes out, 30 days pass, collections team starts calling.

But SaaS is different. Your customers are **ongoing subscribers**, not one-time buyers. The relationship doesn't end when they pay the invoice—it's just getting started.

This creates a paradox:
- **You need to be firm enough** that customers prioritize paying you.
- **You need to be empathetic enough** that customers still want to work with you after they pay.

The companies that figure this out have lower DSO *and* higher retention. The ones that don't end up choosing between cash flow and customer lifetime value.

## The Tiered Escalation Framework

The key to balancing firmness and empathy is **graduated escalation**. You match the intensity of your collections effort to the severity and context of the situation.

Here's the framework we use:

### Tier 1: Gentle Reminders (Days 1-30)

**Goal:** Make it easy for customers to pay without creating friction.

**Tactics:**
- Automated email reminders at Day 5, Day 10, Day 15, Day 20, and Day 30
- Friendly, helpful tone: "Just a reminder that Invoice #12345 for $X is now due."
- Include payment link and multiple payment options
- No threats, no urgency language

**Why it works:** 60-70% of late payments in SaaS are **administrative oversights**. The invoice was lost, the AP person is on vacation, the approval workflow got stuck. A gentle reminder solves the problem.

**Example email (Day 10):**

> Subject: Reminder: Invoice #12345 Due
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> This is a quick reminder that Invoice #12345 for $8,500 was due on [date]. If you've already submitted payment, thank you—please disregard this message.
>
> If you need any assistance or have questions about the invoice, feel free to reach out. You can also make a payment directly here: [Payment Link]
>
> Thanks,
> [Your Name]
> Billing Team

**No drama. No pressure. Just a polite nudge.**

### Tier 2: Personal Outreach (Days 31-60)

**Goal:** Understand *why* payment is late and work toward resolution.

**Tactics:**
- Personal email from a human (not automated)
- Offer to help resolve any issues
- Ask open-ended questions: "Is there anything preventing payment?" or "Do you need a revised invoice?"
- Loop in Customer Success if there's a relationship owner

**Why it works:** At 30+ days, there's usually a **reason** for the delay—not just an oversight. Maybe the invoice amount is disputed. Maybe the customer is having cash flow issues. Maybe the billing contact changed and nobody told you.

**You need to know the reason before you can solve the problem.**

**Example email (Day 35):**

> Subject: Following up on Invoice #12345
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I wanted to personally follow up on Invoice #12345 for $8,500, which is now 35 days past due. I know things can get busy, so I wanted to check in—is there anything we can help with to resolve this?
>
> If there's a question about the invoice, or if there's an issue on your end that's delaying payment, I'm happy to work through it with you. Just let me know how we can help.
>
> Looking forward to hearing from you.
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]
> [Direct Contact Info]

**Notice the tone:** helpful, not accusatory. You're assuming positive intent.

### Tier 3: Executive Involvement (Days 61-90)

**Goal:** Escalate internally and externally to signal seriousness.

**Tactics:**
- Email from a senior leader (VP of Finance, VP of Revenue Operations, etc.)
- CC the customer's account owner (CSM or AE) for visibility
- Set a clear expectation: "We need to resolve this by [date]."
- Offer payment plans if cash flow is the issue

**Why it works:** At 60+ days, the customer *knows* they owe money. The issue is prioritization. Executive involvement signals that this is important, and it also escalates the issue internally on the customer's side—often AP or Finance needs executive cover to expedite payment.

**Example email (Day 65):**

> Subject: Urgent: Invoice #12345 Overdue 65 Days
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm reaching out because Invoice #12345 for $8,500 is now 65 days past due. We've sent several reminders, but we haven't received payment or a response.
>
> I understand that payment delays happen, and we're willing to work with you. If there's an issue with the invoice or if you need a payment plan, let's discuss options.
>
> However, we do need to resolve this within the next 10 days. Can you let me know by [date] how you'd like to proceed?
>
> I've copied [CSM/AE name] to ensure we're all aligned.
>
> Thanks,
> [Executive Name]
> [Title]

**This is firm, but still professional.** You're setting a deadline, but you're also offering flexibility.

### Tier 4: Final Notice & Service Suspension (Days 91+)

**Goal:** Collect payment or suspend service to stop further value delivery without payment.

**Tactics:**
- Final notice with a specific suspension date
- Legal language if necessary ("continued non-payment may result in suspension and potential collections activity")
- Clear path to reinstatement if payment is made
- Notification to CSM and Account Executive

**Why it works:** At 90+ days, the customer is either **unable** or **unwilling** to pay. Continuing to deliver service without payment is unsustainable. Suspension protects your company and often motivates payment.

**Example email (Day 95):**

> Subject: Final Notice: Invoice #12345 – Service Suspension Scheduled
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> Despite multiple attempts to contact you, Invoice #12345 for $8,500 remains unpaid after 95 days.
>
> We will suspend service on [date—7 days from now] if payment is not received. Once service is suspended, access will be restored immediately upon receipt of payment.
>
> If there are extenuating circumstances or if you'd like to discuss a resolution, please contact me directly at [phone/email] by [date].
>
> Sincerely,
> [Executive Name]
> [Title]

**This is the end of the line.** You've been patient, you've offered help, and now you're protecting your business.

## Automation + Human Judgment

The best collections strategies use **automation for consistency** and **human judgment for nuance**.

### What to Automate
- Tier 1 reminders (Days 1-30)
- Invoice delivery and confirmation tracking
- Payment reminders sent on schedule
- Escalation triggers (e.g., "Flag for human review at Day 31")

### What Requires Humans
- Any communication after Day 30
- Negotiating payment plans
- Disputed invoice resolution
- Executive escalation decisions
- Service suspension decisions

We built a collections dashboard in our ERP that flags accounts by aging category:

| Aging Bucket | Count | Total AR | Action Required |
|--------------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 0-30 days | 850 | $4.2M | Automated reminders |
| 31-60 days | 42 | $680K | Personal outreach |
| 61-90 days | 8 | $210K | Executive escalation |
| 90+ days | 3 | $95K | Suspension review |

Every Monday, the collections team reviews the 31+ day accounts. Every account gets a **status and next action**—either "waiting on customer response" or "escalate to Tier 3."

**This makes collections proactive, not reactive.**

## Payment Plans and Flexibility

One of the best tools in your collections arsenal is **flexibility**.

If a customer is struggling with cash flow but wants to maintain the relationship, offer a payment plan:

- **Split the payment:** Half now, half in 30 days.
- **Extended terms:** Net 60 instead of Net 30 going forward.
- **Prepayment discount:** Offer 5% off if they can pay in full immediately.

We once had a customer 120 days overdue on a $50K invoice. After multiple escalations, we learned they were going through a funding gap. We offered a 3-month payment plan: $17K now, $17K in 30 days, $16K in 60 days.

They accepted, paid on schedule, and remained a customer for three more years.

**That's a win.** You collected the revenue, you preserved the relationship, and you demonstrated that you're a reasonable partner.

## The "Too Big to Suspend" Problem

Here's a common scenario: Your largest customer—$2M/year—is 90 days past due on a $150K invoice. Collections has escalated. The CFO says, "Suspend them." The CSM says, "We can't—they're our biggest account, and we're negotiating an expansion."

**What do you do?**

This is where policy meets pragmatism. Here's my framework:

1. **Separate the collections issue from the relationship issue.** Non-payment is a collections problem. The expansion negotiation is a sales problem. Don't let the latter hold the former hostage.

2. **Set a hard deadline with executive sponsorship.** Loop in your CEO or CFO. Make it clear: payment by [date], or service suspension regardless of account size.

3. **Use the expansion as leverage.** The CSM should say: "We're excited about the expansion, but our finance team has flagged the overdue invoice. Let's get that resolved so we can move forward."

4. **Suspend if necessary.** If the customer won't pay, suspend. Sounds extreme, but here's the reality: a customer who refuses to pay $150K won't pay $2M either. Suspending protects you from further losses.

I've seen companies avoid suspending a major account for six months while the past-due balance grew to $500K. When they finally suspended, the customer paid within 48 hours.

**They were always going to pay. They just needed to know you were serious.**

## When to Write It Off

Not every past-due invoice is collectible. Sometimes, you need to write it off and move on.

**When to write off:**
- Customer has gone out of business
- Legal action would cost more than the invoice amount
- Customer disputes the charge and you don't have documentation
- Collection efforts have cost more than the invoice value

We use a 180-day threshold: if we haven't collected after 180 days and legal action isn't viable, we write it off.

**But we never write off without exhausting reasonable collection efforts.** Write-offs are expensive—not just the revenue loss, but the signal it sends to other customers.

## The ROI of Smart Collections

Let's talk numbers.

**Scenario:** $100M ARR company, $10M in outstanding AR, DSO of 45 days.

If you implement a tiered collections strategy and reduce DSO by 10 days:
- **$2.7M in accelerated cash flow** (10 days of daily revenue)
- **Improved working capital** available for reinvestment
- **Lower borrowing costs** (if you use credit lines to cover cash gaps)

And the relationship benefits:
- **Fewer cancellations** due to aggressive collections
- **Higher customer satisfaction** ("They worked with us when we had a cash flow issue")
- **Better internal morale** (your team isn't making threatening calls all day)

**This isn't soft stuff. It's measurable.**

## The Bottom Line

You can be firm and empathetic at the same time.

A collections strategy that preserves relationships starts with **assuming positive intent**, uses **graduated escalation**, offers **flexibility when appropriate**, and **protects your business when necessary**.

The goal isn't to be nice. The goal is to **collect what's owed while maintaining the customer lifetime value.**

At scale, that balance is the difference between a collections function that's purely reactive and one that's a strategic asset—reducing DSO, preserving relationships, and protecting cash flow without burning bridges.

Build the framework. Automate the easy stuff. Apply judgment to the hard cases.

Your CFO will love the DSO improvement. Your customers will appreciate the professionalism. And your team will thank you for giving them a playbook that doesn't make them feel like the bad guy.
