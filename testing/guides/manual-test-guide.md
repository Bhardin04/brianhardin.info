## Manual Browser Testing Instructions

Since automated browser testing is encountering technical issues, please follow these manual testing steps:

### 1. Navigate to Contact Page
- Open browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/contact
- **Expected**: Page loads with contact form visible

### 2. Test Empty Form Validation
- Click "Send Message" button without filling any fields
- **Expected**: Browser should show validation messages for required fields (name, email, subject, message)

### 3. Test Invalid Email Format
- Fill in:
  - Name: "Test User"
  - Email: "invalid-email" (no @ symbol)
  - Subject: "Test Subject"
  - Message: "Test message"

- **Expected**: Browser should show email validation error

### 4. Test Valid Form Submission
- Fill in:
  - Name: "Test User"
  - Email: "test@example.com"

### 5. Test Mobile Responsiveness
